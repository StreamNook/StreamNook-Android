//! Tells each window whether it is minimized, because the page cannot tell.
//!
//! `CalculateNativeWinOcclusion` is disabled in the WebView2 browser args (it
//! wedged the UI thread in a blocking COM call whenever the window was covered
//! or the shell queried it), so Chromium never learns the window is minimized:
//! `document.visibilityState` stays `visible`, rAF keeps running at the
//! display rate, CSS animations continue and a minimized playing stream costs a
//! full renderer plus the GPU process (2026-09-01 audit, P1-3). Every
//! visibility gate on the page was therefore inert exactly when it mattered.
//!
//! Rust does know: `WebviewWindow::is_minimized` is the Win32 truth. This polls
//! it once a second for every window (a dispatch to the UI thread, microseconds)
//! and emits `window-visibility { hidden }` to that window on change. The page
//! folds it into the same `isWindowHidden()` its gates already read, pauses
//! CSS animations and takes the video element out of the render tree while
//! hidden (audio keeps playing; only compositing stops).
//!
//! The same pass records whether any window is on screen at all, so Rust
//! pollers that only feed the UI can sleep while everything is minimized or
//! in the tray (`all_hidden`).
