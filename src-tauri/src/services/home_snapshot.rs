//! Rust-owned Home snapshot: the data the Home grid and the Sidebar render,
//! kept warm by Rust on its own cadence and handed to any window in one call.
//!
//! Before this, three JavaScript timers re-fetched the same followed list
//! (Sidebar every 3 min, Home on every mount after a 300 ms delay, the live
//! notification loop every 60 s in Rust and throwing the result away), the
//! offline roster and its last-broadcast times lived in Home component state
//! and were refetched on every reopen, and hype trains were polled from
//! JavaScript every 30 s. Reopening Home therefore meant two network round
//! trips before the grid was current.
//!
//! Now one poll per section runs here:
//!
//! - followed live: every 60 s while signed in; feeds the live-notification
//!   diff as well, so the one Helix call serves notifications, Sidebar and Home.
//! - offline follows + last broadcasts: every 10 min while signed in, and on
//!   demand when a Home mounts with a stale section.
//! - recommended page 1: every 5 min, only while a Home is mounted.
//! - hype trains: every 30 s while any window exists, for the channels on
//!   screen (followed live + recommended + whatever a Home reports through
//!   `set_extra_channels`: category and search results).
//! - collaborations (Shared Viewership): no timer of their own. They are
//!   fetched right behind every list's viewer counts (followed, recommended,
//!   the next recommended page, a Home's category and search results) and
//!   sent AHEAD of that list, so a card paints with its group instead of
//!   gaining it a poll later. Skipped while no window is on screen; a Home
//!   mount catches up. See `services::collaboration`.
//! - shared chats (Shared Chat outside a Stream Together group): started by
//!   every collaborations pass, as a background pass of their own so the
//!   per-channel Helix lookups never hold a list back; channels already in a
//!   group are skipped. Signed out, nothing. See `services::shared_chat`.
//! - watch streaks: hourly, for the followed-live channels.
//! - drops: active campaigns plus the inventory's active game names, hourly
//!   while any window exists and on mount when stale.
//! - continue watching: **no poll loop at all.** The row is derived from the
//!   local VOD watch-position store, which only changes when the viewer
//!   watches something, so it is rebuilt on Home mount, on a trailing-edge
//!   notify from `report_vod_position` / `clear_vod_progress` while a Home is
//!   actually on screen, and on manual refresh. Hourly, and only while
//!   mounted, one batched GQL call reconciles the stored entries against
//!   Twitch (deleted VODs, final lengths, real thumbnails for a VOD watched
//!   while it was still recording).
//! - recommended paging: `load_more_recommended` appends the next page to
//!   the same section, so the list stays canonical here.
//! - Discover lists (`unified_discover`): Home's Discover grid on the unified
//!   view, and the Sidebar's second section for whatever scope it shows, both
//!   finished here from one cache of the other platforms' directories. Each
//!   directory is fetched on its own task and the lists are emitted as each one
//!   lands, and rebuilt when anything they leave out (follows, live favourites,
//!   the favourite list) changes. A unified Home refetches directories on a
//!   60 s check once 5 min old, never while the main window is hidden or
//!   minimized; the Sidebar alone never polls, it refetches when it is shown a
//!   scope, when it closes, and when the window comes back to the front.
//!
//! What is on screen is claimed per window and per page (`WindowClaims`), not
//! counted: a page that dies without its React cleanup (a destroyed window, a
//! reload) must not leave the polls that follow Home running in the tray.
//!
//! Each section carries its fetch time. A section is emitted to the windows
//! (`home-snapshot`, tagged by section) only when its content changed, so a
//! quiet minute costs nothing on the IPC side. `get_home_snapshot` returns
//! everything at once for a mounting Home; `refresh_home_section` is the
//! manual pull (sidebar close, palette command) with a 15 s floor per section.
