//! The "who else is live" lists, built here and handed over finished: Home's
//! Discover tab on the unified view, and the Sidebar's second section
//! (Recommended, or a platform's Top live). Both surfaces render them as-is.
//!
//! Before this, `Home.tsx` and `Sidebar.tsx` each fetched the other platforms'
//! directories themselves and, on every render, concatenated them with Twitch's
//! picks, filtered, sorted and deduplicated the result. Everything the lists
//! need already lived in Rust: the recommendations and live Twitch follows
//! (`home_snapshot`), every other platform's live follows
//! (`provider_live_service`), the live favourites (`favorite_live_service`) and
//! the favourite list (settings). One cache of directories now serves both
//! surfaces; each takes its own `View` of it.
//!
//! A build leaves out:
//!
//! - channels the Following tab already shows, matched by CHANNEL
//!   (`key::channel_ids`). Not by card key: a YouTube directory row is keyed by
//!   video id while a follow row for the same channel is often keyed by UC id,
//!   and a card-key compare lets both through;
//! - live favourites, which the Favourites section shows above the grid,
//!   matched by favourite id (`key::favorite_id`) for the same reason;
//! - repeated cards, by the key the grid renders with (`key::stream_key`),
//!   keeping the most watched.
//!
//! Across every platform it ranks by viewers. The sort is stable, so equal
//! counts keep source order: Twitch first, then each platform in `PROVIDER_IDS`
//! order. A single platform keeps its own order, as its directory ranks it.
//!
//! This module is pure state, with no clock, network or window of its own.
//! `home_snapshot` fetches each directory on its own task, lands it here and
//! emits whatever `rebuild` hands back, which is what lets the tests below land
//! platforms one at a time.
