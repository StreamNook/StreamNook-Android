//! Signing an account out of a platform's sign-in profile, and starting a
//! sign-in from a clean one.
//!
//! TikTok, YouTube and Kick are signed in to through their own web pages, in the
//! shared login overlay, each inside a persistent WebView2 profile of its own;
//! Rust then reads the session off that profile's cookie jar. Two traps follow,
//! and every platform signed in this way has to handle both.
//!
//! Deleting a profile's folder does not sign it out. The browser behind a
//! profile can outlive its window, holding the session in memory and its files
//! open, so the delete fails quietly and the session survives. Only a webview on
//! the profile reaches that browser, so the clear goes through one, and counts
//! as done only once the session cookie is gone.
//!
//! And a sign-in that polls the jar takes the first session it finds. A profile
//! still holding a signed-out account's session hands that account straight
//! back, on the first poll, before the user has typed anything. So a fresh
//! sign-in mounts its overlay on a blank page, clears the profile through it, and
//! only then opens the login page; and it never takes the session the profile
//! held when it began.
//!
//! On macOS the sign-in pages have no store of their own, so there a clear
//! removes only the platform's own cookies: see `clear`.
