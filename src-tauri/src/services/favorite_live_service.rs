//! Who's-live polling for FAVOURITED channels.
//!
//! A sibling of `provider_live_service`, not an extension of it, and the split
//! is deliberate: that service answers "who that you FOLLOW is live", and its
//! `provider-live-update` event feeds the Following list and the sidebar's
//! Followed section. Folding favourites into it would quietly relabel a channel
//! you merely favourited as one you follow.
//!
//! It is also not part of `live_notification_service`, which is gated on
//! `live_notifications.enabled` — putting favourites there would mean silencing
//! notifications also emptied the sidebar's Favourites section.
//!
//! What makes this necessary at all: Twitch liveness comes from
//! `get_followed_streams` and provider liveness from `Settings.provider_follows`.
//! A channel in neither list is invisible to both, which is exactly what a
//! favourite-without-a-follow is.
//!
//! Coverage, and its limits:
//!   twitch  60s   one Helix call per 100 ids. Needs a user token; there is no
//!                 client-credentials path (see `TwitchService::get_token`), so
//!                 signed out this simply doesn't run.
//!   kick    60s   one batched `live_check` per 50 slugs.
//!   youtube 180s  per-channel page fetches, hard-capped per sweep. See below.
//!   tiktok  180s  per-channel profile fetches, capped per sweep. TikTok has no
//!                 batched liveness endpoint, and a channel whose chat socket is
//!                 already open is answered from that instead of a fetch.
//!
//! A channel that is also followed is checked here as well (see `plan` for why
//! the follow poller alone can miss it), but only the follow poller announces
//! it going live.
//!
//! Every source has a poller of its own, on its own clock, and its rows land
//! the moment its check returns: a slow YouTube pass never holds back a Twitch
//! or Kick favourite.
//!
//! Results reach the frontend the same two ways the provider poller uses: a
//! `favorites-live-update` event carrying the whole snapshot, and, on an
//! offline -> live edge, `streamer-went-live` — tagged `source: "favorite"` so
//! the frontend can gate it on its own setting and tell the two watchers apart.
