//! Channel links: which channels on different platforms are the same streamer.
//!
//! A multistreamer's community is split across Twitch, Kick and YouTube, and
//! nothing else in the app knows those rooms belong together. This is the one
//! place that does, so the chat panel can merge them into whichever one the
//! viewer is actually watching.
//!
//! A group is addressed by ANY of its members rather than by a designated
//! primary, so the same link resolves whether the viewer arrives from Twitch or
//! from Kick. A channel belongs to at most one group; linking a channel that
//! already belongs elsewhere moves it, because two groups claiming the same
//! channel would make lookup order decide the answer.
//!
//! Storage and lookup only. The probe that SUGGESTS links lives alongside this:
//! Kick by an exact channel lookup, YouTube through one search call, never a
//! watch-page fetch, because a burst of those gets the IP challenged.
