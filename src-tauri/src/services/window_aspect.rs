//! Live aspect-ratio constraint for the main window.
//!
//! # Why this is a native hook and not a resize handler
//!
//! The aspect-ratio lock used to be a correction applied AFTER the fact: the
//! frontend listened to `onResized`, debounced 100 ms, asked Rust for a
//! conforming size and called `setSize()`. Two properties of that design make a
//! drag feel broken rather than locked:
//!
//! 1. **Dragging a window edge runs the OS modal sizing loop.** `onResized`
//!    fires throughout it, so any pause longer than the debounce lands a
//!    `setSize()` *inside* the loop. That corrupts the loop's cached rect
//!    exactly the way it does for the titlebar move loop (see
//!    `start_titlebar_drag`), and the next mouse movement re-applies the rect
//!    the loop still believes in, so the window jumps back to a size the user
//!    never asked for.
//! 2. **The formula locked one axis and derived the other.** With chat on the
//!    right the width was authoritative, so the whole vertical delta of a
//!    bottom-edge or corner drag was discarded; with chat on the bottom the
//!    same was true of the horizontal delta. Half of the gestures a user can
//!    make did nothing but snap back.
//!
//! `WM_SIZING` exists for precisely this: the OS hands the app the rect the
//! pointer is dragging towards BEFORE applying it, the app adjusts it in place,
//! and the OS rubber-bands to the adjusted rect. Constraining there gives the
//! feel of a native aspect-locked window - the dragged edge tracks the pointer
//! every frame, and nothing is ever undone after the fact.
//!
//! # Division of labour
//!
//! The frontend owns the *shape* of the constraint (which video aspect ratio,
//! how much chrome sits outside the video box: title bar, sidebar, chat panel
//! and its separator, MultiNook gaps). It pushes that through
//! `set_window_aspect_constraint` whenever it changes. This module only applies
//! it, and only while a user drag is in flight.
//!
//! Offsets arrive in LOGICAL pixels and are scaled with the window's live DPI
//! here, not by the caller: a drag can cross onto a monitor with different
//! scaling mid-gesture, and a cached scale factor would skew the constraint for
//! the rest of the drag.
//!
//! # Platforms
//!
//! Windows constrains live. Everywhere else `constrains_live()` reports false
//! and the frontend keeps its debounced correction, which is jerky but is what
//! those platforms had before this module existed. The two paths are mutually
//! exclusive by construction: the frontend asks, once, which one is in force.

/// This is the same argument the module header makes for `WM_SIZING`, arrived at

/// and a minimum size on its top-level window, and the window manager applies
/// them DURING the drag, so the pointer never gets ahead of the frame and
/// nothing snaps back afterwards. A resize handler that corrects the window
/// after the fact is the exact behaviour this module exists to replace.
///
/// # Why a base size
///
/// `PAspect` on its own would lock the ratio of the whole window. `PBaseSize`
/// tells the WM to apply the ratio to the window MINUS the base, which is
/// EXACTLY this module's model: the ratio describes the video box, and
/// `EXTRA_W` / `EXTRA_H` are the chrome around it. Without the base size the
/// WM would lock the ratio of the whole window including chat and the title
/// bar, which is the wrong rectangle and would look like the lock was simply
/// mis-tuned.
///
/// # Why X11 directly
///
/// The Linux build runs on the CEF runtime (`rt.rs`), whose windows are plain
/// X11 windows: `gtk_window()` answers with an error there, so the hints are
/// written on the X window itself (`linux_x11::set_normal_hints`), which is
/// the property GTK's `set_geometry_hints` wrote underneath. X11 hints are in
/// device pixels, unlike GTK's logical ones, so the frontend's logical values
/// are scaled by the window's scale factor here.
