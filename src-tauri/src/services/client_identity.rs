//! What this client IS: version, OS, architecture, build channel.
//!
//! One definition, because there used to be three and they disagreed. The
//! admin dashboard was reading whichever won a race:
//!
//! - `users.app_version` came from JS `getVersion()` (the merged Tauri config).
//! - The presence payload came from `get_current_app_version`
//!   (`env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`).
//! - The updater kept a private third copy of `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.
//!
//! On desktop those agree only because the release scripts happen to bump both
//! files; `tests/version_parity.rs` now makes that a hard guarantee instead of
//! a habit. On ANDROID they never agreed: `tauri.android.conf.json` overrides
//! the version for Gradle and never reaches Cargo, so the Cargo number is the
//! DESKTOP one inside a phone build. Android reported 8.3.9 to Supabase once
//! for exactly this reason.
//!
//! So `app_version` here reads the MERGED CONFIG (`package_info().version`),
//! which is correct on both platforms from one line of code, and every reporter
//! reads it from here.
//!
//! `target` is the `<os>-<arch>` key the update manifest already uses, produced
//! by the same function the updater calls (`current_update_target`, moved here
//! from `commands::components`). Update artifacts and the report therefore share
//! one key space by construction, which is what makes "which platform is stuck
//! on an old version" answerable at all: before this, every desktop OS reported
//! the single string `"desktop"`, so Windows, macOS and Linux were
//! indistinguishable both online and offline.
