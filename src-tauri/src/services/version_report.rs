//! Periodic "this client is alive, and this is what it is" report.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Before this service, `users.last_seen` and `users.app_version` were written
//! by exactly one thing: the frontend's `upsertUser`, whose only caller is gated
//! on the login TRANSITION (`AppStore.checkAuthStatus`, `if (!wasAuthenticated)`).
//! Nothing refreshed them afterwards. The consequences were all live in
//! production on 2026-09-19:
//!
//! - Closing to tray hides the window instead of exiting, so a client left
//!   running reported the timestamp of its last cold boot for as long as it
//!   stayed up. `last_seen` measured LOGINS, not usage, and DAU/WAU/MAU are
//!   computed straight off it.
//! - A member who switches accounts, or signs out of the active one and gets a
//!   linked account promoted, never re-enters that branch at all: their row was
//!   absent rather than stale.
//! - A client whose single write failed had no second chance for the rest of the
//!   session, and nothing anywhere recorded that it had failed. That cohort went
//!   INVISIBLE rather than looking broken, which is the worst possible failure
//!   for a measurement that decisions get made on.
//!
//! ## Why Rust
//!
//! It outlives every window (the main window is destroyed on close-to-tray and
//! recreated on demand), it must not depend on any page being mounted or any
//! React effect surviving, and the update-check outcome it carries is already
//! Rust-side state. Same reasoning as `home_snapshot` and the Rust-owned chat
//! state: if a fact belongs to the running client, the client's own process owns
//! reporting it.
//!
//! ## Two deliberate choices
//!
//! **It does not consult `client_config.write_via_api`.** That flag has never
//! once been true in production: `clientConfig.ts` reads it from the update
//! manifest, and the release pipeline rebuilds that manifest every ship without
//! ever emitting the key. A report that can be switched off by a field nobody
//! sets is a report that never runs. `/api/v1/user/sync` is server-authoritative
//! (it takes the user id from the bearer token, never the body), so there is
//! nothing to gate.
//!
//! **A failure is counted and reported on recovery.** `report_failures` rides
//! the next successful send, so a client that could not report for an hour says
//! so once it can. Without that, a broken cohort is silently missing and the
//! dashboard reads 100% healthy.
