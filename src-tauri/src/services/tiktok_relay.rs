//! Local HLS relay for TikTok LIVE.
//!
//! Every TikTok stream is served from here, which is why `TikTokSource` always
//! reports `PlaybackKind::LocalHls` rather than the plain `Hls` kind. The
//! reason is the grid: `multi_nook_server` answers 404 for any path that is not
//! `stream.m3u8`, so it can only carry a platform whose segment URLs are both
//! absolute and served by a CORS-open CDN. Kick's IVS is; TikTok's pull CDN is
//! not known to be, and its playlists may carry relative URIs. Serving TikTok
//! from here makes the question moot and makes solo and grid playback the same
//! code path.
//!
//! One server for the process, one session per `stream_id`, addressed by the
//! `/s/{id}/` path prefix. That prefix is what keeps two tiles from serving each
//! other's bytes: it is in every URL the player is ever handed, so there is no
//! shared mutable "current stream" to get out of step.
//!
//! ```text
//! /s/{id}/stream.m3u8   master, one variant (every mode)
//!
//! HLS upstream
//! /s/{id}/live.m3u8     the media playlist, URIs rewritten to `up/{n}`
//! /s/{id}/up/{n}        one upstream segment or init, relayed
//!
//! DASH upstream, segments held because the CDN keeps only the newest
//! /s/{id}/video.m3u8    /s/{id}/audio.m3u8
//! /s/{id}/iv, /ia       inits          /s/{id}/v/{n}, /a/{n}   segments
//!
//! FLV upstream, cut into fMP4 here
//! /s/{id}/flv.m3u8      the media playlist, audio and video muxed
//! /s/{id}/fi/{epoch}    init per codec configuration
//! /s/{id}/f/{n}         segments
//! ```

// serves a segment only while it is the newest one: measured, the moment a newer
// number appears the previous one answers 404, whatever shift buffer the
// manifest advertises. So this relay takes each segment while it is newest and
// holds it, on a timer of its own. Capture driven by the player's polling would
