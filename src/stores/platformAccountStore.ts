/**
 * Connection state for the platforms that have an account you can connect.
 *
 * This replaces six separate `setInterval(check, 5000)` effects — two in
 * ChatWidget (once per Kick/YouTube pane), two in BlendedChatPane, two in
 * ConnectionsSettings. Every one of them polled `kick_is_connected` /
 * `youtube_is_connected`, which are pure in-memory reads: they answer "do we hold
 * a token", never "does it still work". So they burned an IPC round trip each,
 * per pane, forever, and could not detect the one thing worth detecting.
 *
 * There are NO intervals here. Connection state changes for exactly four reasons,
 * and all four are observable:
 *
 *   1. the user connects or disconnects  -> this store's own actions
 *   2. Rust stored or cleared a token    -> `platform-account-changed` event
 *   3. the session was revoked remotely  -> `usePlatformSessionCheck` (5 min)
 *   4. the window regained focus         -> `usePlatformAccountSync`
 *
 * Connecting is ONE action per platform however many credentials it takes. Kick
 * needs an OAuth token (chat + moderation) AND a kick.com site session (their
 * official API exposes no follow list); YouTube needs a cookie session and a
 * subscriptions import. The user should never learn that, so neither half is a
 * separate button and no user-facing string says "import" or "sync".
