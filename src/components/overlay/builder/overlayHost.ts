// What the overlay builder needs from wherever it runs.
//
// The same builder runs in the desktop app (Settings > Stream Overlay) and on
// streamnook.app/overlays, synced one way from here like the renderer. The few
// things that differ between the two are behind this interface: how a request
// reaches the overlays API (Rust holds the Twitch token on desktop; the site uses
// its session cookie), how a channel link is looked up, and which feed drives the
// live preview. Nothing in the builder imports Tauri; a test keeps it that way.
