// Freshness of the followed-streams list for the mobile shell.
//
// Why this exists at all: the Android activity SURVIVES backgrounding, and it
// survives closing a PiP window too (verified against dumpsys - the process and
// the ActivityRecord both stay). So the zustand store keeps whatever it last
// fetched, and reopening the app can show live/offline state, viewer counts and
// titles from hours ago.
//
// Desktop never needed this: Sidebar reloads on hover and on expand, and Home
// reloads on mount, so ordinary navigation keeps the list fresh incidentally.
// The phone shell has no equivalent trigger - FollowingScreen's mount effect is
// guarded on the list being EMPTY - so before this the only refresh in the whole
// app was pull-to-refresh.
//
// Throttled rather than unconditional because resume fires constantly on a
// phone: every app switch, every return from PiP, every notification glance.
