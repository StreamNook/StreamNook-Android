// A fixed list read from Rust once per run (alert types, notice types), that

// Right after an update or a reboot the first call can fail, or sit
// unanswered while the app comes up. A page that took that as an empty list
// drew its section blank for the whole run (zoox's empty "Notify me about").
// So each try gets a time limit, a failed or empty answer is tried again with
// a growing gap, and only after every try does the caller get an empty list,
// with the next caller starting over.
