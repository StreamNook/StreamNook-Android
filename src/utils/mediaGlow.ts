 * and so passed that guard on every subsequent render: one IPC round trip per
 * grey card per render, for as long as the grid was on screen. The Home grids
 * re-render whenever viewer counts update, so that was a steady background
 * drip, invisible because each individual call worked exactly as designed.
 *
 * Marking the element rather than remembering URLs in a module-level Set keeps

/* ===================== the live half: an ambilight ========================
 *
 * Everything above answers "what colour IS this stream" for a card, once, from
 * a still. Everything below answers a different question — "what is on screen
 * right now" — many times a second, and the two want opposite algorithms.
 *
 * This half does NOT go through Rust, and that is the deliberate reversal of
 * how the still half works. Three reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 *   1. Rate. A light that reads as synced to the picture has to be resampled
 *      roughly every 60ms. Through Rust that is an IPC round trip per frame
 *      per player carrying the frame itself — the bulk media copy the
 *      efficiency standard names outright, at about a hundred times the
 *      traffic the once-every-two-seconds version had.
 *   2. Latency. A round trip lands the colour a frame or more after the frame
 *      it came from, and the in-flight guard drops samples under load. Local
 *      arithmetic lands in the same frame, which is the whole ask.
 *   3. It is arithmetic over a few hundred pixels that already live in this
 *      process, in a buffer this process just allocated.
 *
 * Rust keeps the half where Rust earns it: the still colour is cached by key,
 * shared across surfaces, and survives the UI being torn down. The live colour
 * is none of those things — it is worth 240ms and then it is wrong.
 */
